======= EXPECTATIONS ABOUT CMSC 100 =======
Hello! My name is Bern, a Batch 2021 B.S. Computer Science sophomore.
Below are my short expectations about CMSC 100 (Web Development).

I expect that I would have a glimpse of the following:
  1. Learning more about MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
  2. Differentiating back-end and front-end development
  3. Recognizing my strengths in back-end, front-end, or full-stack development

However, as a beginner who only knows basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts,
I am nervous because this will be my first time trying out most of the languages
and scripts covered by the course. I hope that I do get to learn more.

Looking forward to this semester! :)
