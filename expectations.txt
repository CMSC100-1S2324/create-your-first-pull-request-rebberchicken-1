======= EXPECTATIONS ABOUT CMSC 100 =======
Hello! My name is Bern, a Batch 2021 B.S. Computer Science sophomore.
Below are my short expectations about CMSC 100 (Web Development).

I expect that I would have a glimpse of the following:
  1. Learning more about MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)
  2. Differentiating back-end and front-end development
  3. Recognizing my strengths in back-end, front-end, or full-stack development

However, as a beginner who only knows basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript concepts,
I am nervous because this will be my first time trying out most of the languages
and scripts covered by the course. I hope that I do get to learn more.

Looking forward to this semester! :)

PS. pede magtagalog diba?? hahahahaha okie okie

For number 1, yeah I agree hahaha. Kahit wala akong masyadong idea dun, hopefully learn more on things na about web developing.

Para sa number 2 naman, agree again haha. Actually wala talaga akong alam we developing, slight lang nung CMSC 12, kaya really looking forward to it especially yung frontend hehehe.

Sa number 3 naman, I think madidiscover mo sya teh since magaling si sir haha. For me naman, meron nakong idea kung saan gusto ko ehehe.

my last comment, I think most of us naman kinakabahan sa mga upcoming lessons so kapit lang kapatid, kakayanin natin tong lahat. Hopefully all of us will learn a lot of things that will help us to discover our passion in life hehe.
